# 1641 Depositions Corpus

The 1641 depositions are a collection of 8,000 depositions or witness statements, examinations and associated materials, amounting to 19,010 pages and bound in 31 volumes. They are written in archaic English making them extremely noisy. The use of language is inconsistent -- the entity ``Devil'' for example has multiple spelling variations, including ``Diuill'', ``Divil'', and no instances of the modern spelling -- and ancient naming conventions make resolving entities to their modern equivalents challenging.

This repository contains an annotated subset of 16 depositions selected from geographically distributed regions around Ireland. Instances of named entities have been tagged and annotated with entity types and a disambiguation URI from DBpedia where possible.

The corpus is in NIF format
